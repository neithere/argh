Similar projects
================

Obviously, `Argh` is not the only CLI helper library in the Python world.
It was created when some similar solutions already existed; more appeared
later on.  There are valid reasons behind maintaining most projects.

The list below is nowhere near exhausting; certain items are yet to be
reviewed; the comments should have been more structured.  However, it gives
a picture of the alternatives.

Ideally, we'd need a table with the following columns: supports argparse;
has integrated parser; requires subclassing; supports nested commands;
is bound to an unrelated piece of software; involves "magic" (i.e. undermines
clarity); depends on outdated libraries; has simple API; has unobtrusive API;
supports Python3.  Not every "yes" in this table would count as pro.

* argdeclare_ requires additional classes and lacks support for nested
  commands.
* argparse-cli_ requires additional classes.
* django-boss_ seems to lack support for nested commands and is strictly
  Django-specific.
* entrypoint_ is lightweight but involves a lot of magic and seems to lack
  support for nested commands.
* opster_ and finaloption_ support nested commands but are based on the
  outdated `optparse` library and therefore reimplement some features available
  in `argparse`. They also introduce decorators that don't just decorate
  functions but change their behaviour, which is a questionable practice.
* simpleopt_ has an odd API and is rather a simple replacement for standard
  libraries than an extension.
* opterator_ is based on the outdated `optparse` and does not support nested
  commands.
* clap_ ships with its own parser and therefore is incompatible with
  `clap`-agnostic code.
* plac_ is a very powerful alternative to `argparse`. I'm not sure if it's
  worth migrating but it is surely very flexible and easy to use.
* baker_
* plumbum_
* docopt_ takes an inverted approach: you write the usage docs, it generates a
  parser.  Then you need to wire the parsing results into you code manually.
* aaargh_
* cliff_
* cement_
* autocommand_
* click_ is a rather popular library, a bit younger than Argh.  The authors of
  both libraries even gave lightning talks on a PyCon within a few minutes :)
  Although I expected it to kill Argh because it comes with Flask, in fact
  it takes an approach so different from Argh that they can coexist.
  Like Opster, Click's decorator replaces the underlying function (a
  questionable practice); it does not derive the CLI arguments from the
  function signature but entirely relies on additional decorators, while Argh
  strives for the opposite.
