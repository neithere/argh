The `argh` library is supported (and tested unless otherwise specified) on
the following versions of Python:

* 2.7 (including PyPy 1.8)
* 3.1 (`argparse` library is required; **not** tested)
* 3.4
* 3.5

.. versionchanged:: 0.15
   Added support for Python 3.x, dropped support for Python ≤ 2.5.

   Argh may perfectly work under 3.3, I'm just not testing it.
