Agrh, argparse!
===============

Did you ever say "argh" trying to remember the details of optparse or argparse
API? If yes, this package may be useful for you. It provides a very simple
wrapper for argparse with support for hierarchical commands that can be bound
to modules or classes. Argparse can do it; argh makes it easy.

In a nutshell
-------------

Here's a list of features that `argh` adds to `argparse`:

* mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before the parser
  is instantiated;
* nesed commands made easy: no messing with subparsers (though they are of
  course used under the hood);
* infer agrument type from the default value;
* infer command name from function name;
* add an alias root command ``help`` for the ``--help`` argument;
* enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of a
  :class:`argparse.Namespace` object.

`Argh` is fully compatible with `argparse`. You can mix `argh`-agnostic and
`argh`-aware code. Just keep in mind that :func:`argh.dispatch` does some extra
work that a custom dispatcher may not do.

Installation
------------

    $  pip install argh

Example
-------

A very simple application with one command::

    @arg('text')  # signature is same as ArgumentParser.add_argument
    def echo(args):
        print args.text
    
    parser = ArghParser()
    parser.add_commands([echo])

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parser.dispatch()
