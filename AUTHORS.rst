    This list used to be manually updated at the early stages of Argh
    development.  As the list of contributions grew, it became increasingly
    harder to track them.

    Fortunately, Github offers this awesome tool:
    https://github.com/neithere/argh/graphs/contributors

    Please refer to the Github report for recent contributions.

    Also, please don't hesitate to file issues_ and create pull requests

Thanks to the authors of argparse_ for the excellent library for which Argh
is merely a wrapper.

Thanks to Andrey Kislyuk for writing argcomplete_ and thus allowing Argh
to remain compact.

Thanks to the authors of py.test_, tox_, virtualenv_, mock_ and related
projects (or ideas) for automating the routine and letting the developer focus
on the task and enjoy TDD.

.. _virtualenv: https://pypi.org/pypi/virtualenv

Thanks to Bitbucket_ team for the not-too-commercial approach to the excellent
tools they provide.  The early years of Argh development were spent on that
platform.

Thanks to Github_ team for the place where Argh has been developed for over a
decade.
