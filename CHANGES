Version 0.26.2-dev
------------------

Other changes:

- Removed official support for Python 3.4, added for 3.5.
- Various tox-related improvements for development.
- Improved documentation.

Version 0.26.1
--------------

Fixed bugs:

- The undocumented (and untested) argument `dispatch(..., pre_call=x)`
  was broken; fixing because at least one important app depends on it
  (issue #63).

Version 0.26
------------

This release is intended to be the last one before 1.0.  Therefore a major
cleanup was done.  This **breaks backward compatibility**.  If your code is
really outdated, please read this list carefully and grep your code.

- Removed decorator `@alias` (deprecated since v.0.19).

- Removed decorator `@plain_signature` (deprecated since v.0.20).

- Dropped support for old-style functions that implicitly expected namespace
  objects (deprecated since v.0.21).  The `@expects_obj` decorator is now
  mandatory for such functions.

- Removed decorator `@command` (deprecated since v.0.21).

- The `@wrap_errors` decorator now strictly requires that the error classes
  are given as a list (old behaviour was deprecated since v.0.22).

- The `allow_warnings` argument is removed from
  `argh.completion.autocomplete()`.  Debug-level logging is used instead.
  (The warnings were deprecated since v.0.25).

Some more stuff has been scheduled **to be purged before 1.0**:

- Deprecated arguments `title`, `help` and `description` in `add_commands()`
  helper function.  See documentation and issue #60.

Other changes:

- Improved representation of default values in the help.

- Dispatcher can be configured to skip unknown arguments (issue #57).

- Added `add_subcommands()` helper function (a convenience wrapper
  for `add_commands()`).

- `EntryPoint` now stores kwargs for the parser.

- Added support for default command *with* nested commands (issue #78).

  This only works with Python 3.4+ due to incorrect behaviour or earlier
  versions of Argparse (including the stand-alone one as of 1.2.1).

  Due to argparse peculiarities the function assignment technique relies
  on a special `ArghNamespace` object.  It is used by default in `ArghParser`
  and the shortcuts, but if you call the vanilla `ArgumentParser.parse_args()`
  method, you now *have* to supply the proper namespace object.

Fixed bugs:

- Help formatter was broken for arguments with empty strings as default values
  (issue #76).

Version 0.25
------------

- Added EntryPoint class as another way to assemble functions (issue #59).

- Added support for Python 3.4; dropped support for Python 3.3
  (this doesn't mean that Argh is necessarily broken under 3.3, 
  it's just that I'm not testing against it anymore).

- Shell completion warnings are now deprecated in favour of `logging`.

- The command help now displays default values of all arguments (issue #64).

- Function docstrings are now displayed verbatim in the help (issue #64).

- Argh's dispatching now should work properly in Cython.
