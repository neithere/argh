Version 0.28.0
--------------

A major cleanup.

Backward incompatible changes:

- Dropped support for Python 2.7 and 3.7.

Deprecated features, to be removed in v.0.30:

- `argh.assembling.SUPPORTS_ALIASES`.

  - Always `True` for recent versions of Python.

- `argh.io.safe_input()` AKA `argh.interaction.safe_input()`.

  - Not relevant anymore.  Please use the built-in `input()` instead.

- argument `pre_call` in `dispatch()`.

   Even though this hack seems to have been used in some projects, it was never
   part of the official API and never recommended.

   Describing your use case in the `discussion about shared arguments`_ can
   help improve the library to accomodate it in a proper way.

   .. _discussion about shared arguments: https://github.com/neithere/argh/issues/63

- Argument help as annotations.

  - Annotations will only be used for types after v.0.30.
  - Please replace any instance of::

      def func(foo: "Foobar"):

    with the following::

      @arg('-f', '--foo', help="Foobar")
      def func(foo):

    It will be decided later how to keep this functionality "DRY" (don't repeat
    yourself) without conflicts with modern conventions and tools.

- Added deprecation warnings for some arguments deprecated back in v.0.26.

Version 0.27.2
--------------

Minor packaging fix:

* chore: include file required by tox.ini in the sdist (#155)

Version 0.27.1
--------------

Minor building and packaging fixes:

* docs: add Read the Docs config (#160)
* chore: include tox.ini in the sdist (#155)

Version 0.27.0
--------------

This is the last version to support Python 2.7.

Backward incompatible changes:

- Dropped support for Python 2.6.

Enhancements:

- Added support for Python 3.7 through 3.11.
- Support introspection of function signature behind the `@wraps` decorator
  (issue #111).

Fixed bugs:

- When command function signature contained ``**kwargs`` *and* positionals
  without defaults and with underscores in their names, a weird behaviour could
  be observed (issue #104).
- Fixed introspection through decorators (issue #111).
- Switched to Python's built-in `unittest.mock` (PR #154).
- Fixed bug with `skip_unknown_args=True` (PR #134).
- Fixed tests for Python 3.9.7+ (issue #148).

Other changes:

- Included the license files in manifest (PR #112).
- Extended the list of similar projects (PR #87).
- Fixed typos and links in documentation (PR #110, #116, #156).
- Switched CI to Github Actions (PR #153).

Version 0.26.2
--------------

- Removed official support for Python 3.4, added for 3.5.
- Various tox-related improvements for development.
- Improved documentation.

Version 0.26.1
--------------

Fixed bugs:

- The undocumented (and untested) argument `dispatch(..., pre_call=x)`
  was broken; fixing because at least one important app depends on it
  (issue #63).

Version 0.26
------------

This release is intended to be the last one before 1.0.  Therefore a major
cleanup was done.  This **breaks backward compatibility**.  If your code is
really outdated, please read this list carefully and grep your code.

- Removed decorator `@alias` (deprecated since v.0.19).

- Removed decorator `@plain_signature` (deprecated since v.0.20).

- Dropped support for old-style functions that implicitly expected namespace
  objects (deprecated since v.0.21).  The `@expects_obj` decorator is now
  mandatory for such functions.

- Removed decorator `@command` (deprecated since v.0.21).

- The `@wrap_errors` decorator now strictly requires that the error classes
  are given as a list (old behaviour was deprecated since v.0.22).

- The `allow_warnings` argument is removed from
  `argh.completion.autocomplete()`.  Debug-level logging is used instead.
  (The warnings were deprecated since v.0.25).

Deprecated:

- Deprecated arguments `title`, `help` and `description` in `add_commands()`
  helper function.  See documentation and issue #60.

Other changes:

- Improved representation of default values in the help.

- Dispatcher can be configured to skip unknown arguments (issue #57).

- Added `add_subcommands()` helper function (a convenience wrapper
  for `add_commands()`).

- `EntryPoint` now stores kwargs for the parser.

- Added support for default command *with* nested commands (issue #78).

  This only works with Python 3.4+ due to incorrect behaviour or earlier
  versions of Argparse (including the stand-alone one as of 1.2.1).

  Due to argparse peculiarities the function assignment technique relies
  on a special `ArghNamespace` object.  It is used by default in `ArghParser`
  and the shortcuts, but if you call the vanilla `ArgumentParser.parse_args()`
  method, you now *have* to supply the proper namespace object.

Fixed bugs:

- Help formatter was broken for arguments with empty strings as default values
  (issue #76).

Version 0.25
------------

- Added EntryPoint class as another way to assemble functions (issue #59).

- Added support for Python 3.4; dropped support for Python 3.3
  (this doesn't mean that Argh is necessarily broken under 3.3,
  it's just that I'm not testing against it anymore).

- Shell completion warnings are now deprecated in favour of `logging`.

- The command help now displays default values of all arguments (issue #64).

- Function docstrings are now displayed verbatim in the help (issue #64).

- Argh's dispatching now should work properly in Cython.
